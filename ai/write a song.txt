OpenAI response for Prompt: using artificial intelligence write a song 
 *************************



Verse1

Living in the shadows, no one could see

Dreams of a bright future, just out of reach

I don't know where I'm headed, uncertain it seems

But I'm searching deep inside for a higher esteem

Chorus

Searching for answers, so far and wide
Using Artificial Intelligence at my side
Breaking the boundaries of what I knew
A whole new world of possibilities, I'm coming through

Verse 2

Each step an adventure that I'll take
With wonders unfolding that I can make
The passion inside drives me to succeed
Where I'm headed, I won't concede

Chorus 

Searching for answers, so far and wide
Using Artificial Intelligence at my side
Breaking the boundaries of what I knew
A whole new world of possibilities, I'm coming through

Verse 3

Though there is a danger in exploring new lands
The courage and strength drive me to my plans
Gathering the wisdom of the past
To build a better future that will last

Chorus 

Searching for answers, so far and wide
Using Artificial Intelligence at my side
Breaking the boundaries of what I knew
