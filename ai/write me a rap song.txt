OpenAI response for Prompt: using artificial intelligence write me a rap song 
 *************************



[Verse 1]
Too high, can't touch the sky
Sippin' on a potion, the future is mine
Light speed, faster than sound
I'm on the rise, a hip-hop champion crowned

[Chorus]
I keep pushing on, the sky is no limit
My dreams ain't sleepin', artificial intelligence
My mind is racing faster than life
Unstoppable power and endless fire tonight

[Verse 2]
My thoughts beyond you, it's only me
Hear the rhythms, here's what they mean
My tracks just keep on groovin
This flow is too dope, I'm truly movin'

[Chorus]
I keep pushing on, the sky is no limit
My dreams ain't sleepin', artificial intelligence
My mind is racing faster than life
Unstoppable power and endless fire tonight

[Verse 3]
My opponents scared, they witness the greatness
Real competition, they can't handle the stress
I'm off the meter, reachin' for the stars
My success never stops, the beat goes hard
