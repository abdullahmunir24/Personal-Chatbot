 *************************



Softly the petals unfurl
Unveiling the beauty within
The sun casts its warm light
Its beauty cannot be contained 
Life is feeling ever so alive
As dewdrops reflect in the sky
The air is filled with fragrant smells
And there are birdsong of bliss 
Love is like a delicate flower
That reveals its full bloom over time
And a poem come into being 
To enchant us with its rhyme.
